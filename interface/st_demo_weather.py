        ## Motivation
        The motivation behind a lot of this work was to understand how severe weather impacts bus ridership in NYC. The specific task we are 
        training our model to perform is the prediction of the number of passengers on a specific vehicle at a specific time and place. The 
        investigations presented in this demo are common situations in a data science workflow. Data Auditing, Feature Selection, Model Selection, 
        and Error Analysis can all be performed discretely and evaluated visually. Let's see how these tools can be used to gain insight into our 
        primary research question.

        ## Establishing a Baseline
        A sensible first step in assessing the extent to which weather conditions influence the number of people who ride the 
        bus on a given day (in the case of our analysis, the B46 between 8/1 and 9/30/2021) is to establish a baseline predictive 
        model trained in the absence of weather features (e.g., bus position, observation time, and certain timetable details). 
        Then, we can compare the performance of our baseline against that of a substantially similar model trained on exactly the 
        same data plus some additional weather features (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and humidity). If the augmented model 
        performs better than our baseline, we can say that the inclusion of weather features improves our model’s ability to predict 
        bus ridership. Conversely, if the augmented model performs inline with (or worse than) our baseline, we might begin to question 
        if weather has anything to do with people’s decision to ride the bus or, at the very least, attempt to diagnose why our data 
        (or representation thereof) did not lend itself to the prediction task.

        #### Linear
        Our first attempt at establishing a baseline model was to train an unregularized first-degree linear regressor on the first 6 of 
        our 8 weeks of bus data, then test on the final 2 weeks. To evaluate performance, we looked primarily at mean absolute error (MAE) 
        on basis of interpretability with respect to the prediction task at hand (i.e., how many people are currently on the bus). 
        Overall, our linear model performed surprisingly well for a baseline, with an MAE of {lr_bus_MAE:.1f} on the test set, meaning 
        that, on average, it was able to correctly predict occupancy to within roughly {int(round(lr_bus_MAE))} people relative to the 
        number of riders actually observed. When you stop and think about it, that’s not bad at all. In fact, you probably wouldn’t even 
        notice whether there were 8 more or 8 fewer passengers on a given bus (particularly the larger articulated ones that serve the B46). 
        Indeed, we can see our model does a pretty good job of capturing the ebb end flow of ridership over the course of a day.

        Interestingly, heat index and relative humidity are the two most highly-correlated features with passenger count.  While this implies

        relationships between the features that are more relevant to the prediction task than the linear relationships described in the

        To (begin to) get a sense for the non-linear relationships learned by our baseline, we can inspect feature importance, which, in the context

        ## Parting Thoughts
        Though the weather result was clearly disappointing, we think there exists significant room to improve the methods outlined 
        in this demo. 
        
        First of all, our model does not incorporate the inherently sequential nature of the data. The challenge with this kind of 
        representation, however, is unlike conventional timeseries data, ours is made up of many shorter sequences (i.e., individual 
        buses making stops along a route) that overlap one another and generally don’t individually span the entire time window you 
        are looking at. Moreover, because our data is collected at fixed intervals that in many cases exceed the amount of time it 
        takes a bus to travel between two stops, it is generally not possible to establish a 1:1 mapping between set of datapoints 
        collected from an individual vehicle to the full sequence of stops it is scheduled to make (at least not directly from the 
        data or without significant interpolation). 
        
        Second, we likely didn’t look at a long enough period of time to “see” enough weather events to learn anything meaningful. 
        Additionally, the route we focused on, the B46 runs through the heart of Brooklyn, so commuters who rely on it arguably don’t 
        have the kind of transit alternatives (and may therefore be less sensitive to weather conditions) as those who take the M103, 
        for instance, which parallel to the 6 train along Lexington Ave. in Manhattan for a significant portion of its route. 
        
        Third, by formulating the task as predicting of the number of passengers on a specific vehicle at a specific time and place, we 
        preclude the use of information about the state of the network elsewhere at inference time. A potentially interesting alternative 
        to our problem formulation would be to think about the task as predicting the edge weights of a directed acyclic graph, where edge 
        weights are passenger counts aggregated over some period of time.
